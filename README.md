# SwiftUI Playgrounds 🎮

A comprehensive playground repository for SwiftUI experimentation, proof-of-concepts, design patterns, and code reference. This project serves as a sandbox environment for exploring SwiftUI concepts, testing new ideas, and building a personal library of reusable components and patterns.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed to be your personal SwiftUI laboratory where you can:

- **Experiment** with new SwiftUI concepts and APIs
- **Build POCs** (Proof of Concepts) for features and ideas
- **Explore** different design patterns and architectural approaches
- **Test** UI components and animations
- **Store** code snippets and solutions for future reference
- **Learn** through hands-on experimentation
- **Share** knowledge and reusable components

- Swift 5.7+

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/swiftui-playgrounds.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:

   ```

3. Select your target platform and run the project

## 📝 Usage Guidelines

### Adding New Experiments

When adding new experiments or concepts, follow these guidelines:

1. **Create a new folder** for related experiments:
   ```
   SwiftUIPlayground/
   ├── Experiments/
   │   ├── Animations/
   │   ├── CustomViews/
   │   ├── DataFlow/
   │   └── Layouts/
   ```

2. **Use descriptive names** for your files:
   - `CustomButtonExperiment.swift`
   - `AnimatedCardView.swift`
   - `MVVMExampleView.swift`

3. **Add comments** explaining the concept being explored:
   ```swift
   /// Experiment: Custom button with haptic feedback
   /// Purpose: Testing haptic integration in SwiftUI
   /// Date: 2024-01-15
   ```

### Code Organization

- **Views**: UI components and screens
- **Models**: Data structures and business logic
- **ViewModels**: State management and data binding
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and extensions
- **Resources**: Assets, fonts, and configuration files

## 🎨 Experiment Categories

### UI Components
- Custom buttons and controls
- Navigation patterns
- Form components
- Modal presentations

### Animations
- Transitions and transforms
- Spring animations
